# Library Management Information System Using Vue and Spring
This is library management system I decided to build within 10 days
By using JavaScript library known as Vue.js for frontend side and Spring for backend side.

## How did this idea come?
Briefly, This idea came to my mind when I was free of my current projects in Php and 
After finishing most of my Udemy courses abour Spring and Microservices and Simplilearn courses about fullstack development
and more.

## How about Case Study of this project?
This project was made for ENDPK(Ecole Notre Dame Providence de Karubanda) Since I was in my internship session
To to help me in sharpening my skills about fullstack development. Thanks to Library department and School administration
for giving me required information, May Jah bless them.

## How about 10 days of this project development?
This project is supposed to be finished within 10 days because I have mastered required technologies to build this project from
the ground up to the end. Main objective coding this project is to raise my skills to professional level.

Let's go!
