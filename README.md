# Library Management Information System Using Vue and Spring
This is library management system I decided to build within 10 days.
By using JavaScript library known as Vue.js for frontend side and Spring for backend side.

## This is this idea come?
Briefly, This idea came to my mind when I was free of my current projects in Php and 
After finishing most of my Udemy courses abour Spring and Microservices and Simplilearn courses about 
fullstack development and more.

## How about Case Study of this project?
This project was made for ENDPK(Ecole Notre Dame Providence de Karubanda) Since I was in my internship session
To to help me in sharpening my skills about fullstack development. Thanks to Library department and School 
administration for giving me required information, May Jah bless them.

## How about 10 days of this project development?
This project is supposed to be finished within 10 days because I have mastered required technologies to build this 
project from the ground up to the end. Main objective coding this project is to raise my skills to professional level.

## Understanding Library Meaning
Library is a place where many books are kept (Building containing collections of materials, books, media, periodicals, and sometimes films 
and recorded music for use or borrowing by the public or the members of an institution). Library is responsible for housing updated information
in order to meet the user's needs on a daily basis. Here we are talking about School libraries.

## Type of this library
Briefly, the type is categorized as "Academic library because it is generally located on college and it primarily focuses on serving the students, 
sections and their teachers who have access to school. No book is rent outside on within school and sometimes a book can be rent to students when 
they go to holiday by following school rules to students with eagerness to read.

## Librarian participation
Librarian will be of great assistance to help students overcome obstacles and open up paths to answers
Librarian will focuses on encouraging students to read and recomment best book based on student queries instead of spending time in lots of work in 
management of libararies. Supervision will be improved and Checking how book are kept and taken by students (observation)

## ENDPK
Ecole Notre Damme Providence De Karubanda is a secondary school which is located in Huye, Southern Province, Rwanda 
it was established in few years ago with main objective of supporting girl's education. Most of sections taken there are based on Sciences.

## What's Problem Statement?
This library provides hard copies documents to students to help them in their studies expecially in making research to interested students.
Before this project some methods which is manual and computerized were used used interchangeably.

## Why ENDPK Library Management Information System?
In actual fact, This system is about to improve security, management and reduce time wastage while recording all required information about 
book rentals and returns and The automatic way of generating report will be used with needed stats for instance; Top students who use library
and students who read many books and their class and department.

Libraries offer a wealth of knowledge, resources, space and environment to discover the world of books and enjoy studying or just reading for
pleasure. Therefore, It's vital to have a good management system for libraries in behalf of many people including students and librarians.
